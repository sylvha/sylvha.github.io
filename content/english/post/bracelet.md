Recently, I have been thinking of things I would like to do outside of work, 
a hobby maybe? So, I brainstormed some activities that I used to enjoy as a kid
and I remembered making paper bead bracelets in high school. Paper beads are 
made by rolling long thin triangles of paper so that when rolled, they look 
like little beads.

However, paper beads weren't really my thing, I wasn't a fan of the texture and
size of the beads, so I went for a more conventional bracelet. Bead bracelets. 

I bought some beads online, some clear elastic strings and Googled example bead
bracelets online. I found plenty of designs and some caught my eye. It looked
very cute so I saved some and made some bead bracelets for myself.

At the moment, I am still experimenting with different designs but I would like 
to one day make this into some sort of a small business and sell bead bracelets
to those that also like my style.

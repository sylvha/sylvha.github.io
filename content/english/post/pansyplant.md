Earlier this year, I planted some pansy flower seeds from the Woolworths discovery program. They offered lots of different plants but I only got 3 pots. They were Pansy seeds, Cherry tomatoes seeds and a herb. 

## Seedlings

Upon some research, I found out that only one of the three plants I own will thrive in the upcoming winter months - the Pansy flower. Therefore, I planted only these ones. 


Look at them grow.

Things I had learnt from planting: 

As you can see, the seedlings stem start to get really tall and bend over during the first couple days, this is because I was growing them indoors in indirect sunlight which is not ideal for seedlings. The first seedlings also sprouted during a rainy week where there were little sunlight. I learnt to water them from the bottom of the cardboard pot to encourage stronger root growth. This prevents the plant from falling over due to the tall stem. 

Ever since that realisation, I placed my plant in a little plastic container and ensured I filled up the plastic container just enough for the plant daily. I would also place them direct sunlight for half the day but not a whole day as it can be too intense, but luckily, it is winter here so even if I left them for a whole day, they didn't dry out as much. With this change, the new seedlings that sprouted had shorter and thicker stems which was a good sign. 

Keeping them indoors meant they were safe from fungus and insects, but it makes their stems weak. So two weeks after then first seedling sprouted, I would occasionally place them outside for the day to get some sunlight (depends on my mood) and strengthen their stems as the wind blows on them. I never left them overnight because I was worried the cold night would freeze them but maybe they are stronger than I thought. I also read that you can gently run your fingers around them to mimic insects or wind movements if you don't want to put the seedlings outside. 

Once the roots started protruding out from the bottom of the cardboard pot, I had to transfer them to a bigger pot. I had some spare terracotta pots, so I carefully transfer them but the seedling roots were very tangled inside so I definitely lost a couple healthy roots. This process was a lot harder than I thought, I had one hand peeling the cardboard pot and the other juggling 15 seedlings, trying not to break them.

Eventually, I got them to separate and here are some pictures of the repotted seedlings. I didn't know what to do with the cardboard pot so I just scattered them on the pot. Woolworths said they were decompostable so I just put them there but in hindsight, it made the following images questionable.

Because the pots were a little dirty and a lot bigger than the cardboard pot, I had to leave them outside in the cold. But the next morning, they were fine.. and the next morning, and the next. Until, I got up one day and they one of the pots were attacked by some rodent, it was clearly dug by something. I still kept them outside because they were thriving and I just got a bit lazy tending to them, they had the rain and sunlight to care for them. 

Two months later and we have these beautiful flowers...

The flowers were getting infested by bugs so the pot was brought inside and the flowers all bloomed within two weeks. 
They are all yellow pansy but you can see one with two purple petals just in the right corner. 


## Final Thoughts
Planting takes a lot of patience. I waited two weeks for the first seedings to sprout and it felt like a month. 

I would like to plant the other two Woolworths pots when Spring/Summer comes around. I have seen others plant the cherry tomatoes which gets very big so I am excited to get that going and harvest some fruits. 

I remember having a existential realisation that plants are pretty fucking cool. They just need some good soil, sunlight and water to produce fabulous flowers and fruits. I found myself in a YouTube loop of watching others planting fruits and vegetables from seeds and it fascinated me how easy it is to grow vegatables. Unfortunately, I don't have the resources and time to maintain a vegeatable garden at the moment but in the future, I would love to harvest some tomatoes, carrots, lettuce from my little veggie patch.

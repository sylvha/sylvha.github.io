It's graduation time for me! I am not one that likes to be on the spotlight but
I enjoy taking photos as keepsake for the future. So, I did want to be 
somewhat prepared for my graduation - I thought about what to wear, the schedule
for the day and locations that I wanted photos taken. 

As for dress finding, I went out on a shopping day to seek for the dress - this
makes it seem like I am shopping for a big event but I just don't own a lot of 
fancy dresses so I used this opportunity to get myself a nice dress that I will 
definitely reuse after my graduation. I was aware that my graduation ribbon 
would be maroon with a quick online search on the USYD website so I was looking 
for a dress that would match maroon. Balancing a budget and colour of the dress
(also the sizes available) I would a nice maroon tulip looking dress. 

At my university, there are 3 sessions of graduation ceremonies a day. I had a
friend graduating on the same day as me but in the morning session so I planned
to arrive early in the morning for some photos with her and our friend group. My
session was the last one of the day, so I had plenty of time to kill during the
day. I had lunch with some friends, got dressed into the graduation gown and took
some photos with friends that were graduating with me. This was not planned but 
I really enjoyed catching up with them and taking photos.

As the day passed, my friends and family started to arrive for group photos so 
we took some of those before joining the ceremony.

During the ceremony, my head started to hurt and my feet were getting sore from 
walking all day. I regretted not bringing another pair of shoes as I was in 
high heels all day. I ended up with blisters under my feet after the ceremony
and did not enjoy the photoshoot after the ceremony as much as I wanted to 
because I was so exhausted and stressed that I developed a migrane. 
Unfortunately, I don't remember if I had my migrane wafers with me that day but 
I did not feel good on the car ride home. I was very nauseous. 

As soon as I got home that night after the ceremony, I had the migrane wafers
and a really short nap. I had some complementary food that the uni gave us after
the graduation ceremony before ending my day. 

There were some upsides and downsides to my graduation day which makes me
nervous about any other big events where I am in the spotlight. I tend to be an 
overthinker which stresses me out during big days so I want to be more prepared 
in the future and most likely avoid big events as long as I am just a guest. 

Regardless, I had a great day and took lots of photos. I just want this page to 
be a photo dump of all the images I took as keepsake for the years to come.
